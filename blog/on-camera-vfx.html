    <h1>In-Camera VFX</h1>

    <p>Tracking and compositing footage onto a real-world screen is the bane of my existence, so I opted to use in-camera VFX for any necessary cases.</p>
    <p>I really love this approach because it enables the actor to actually react to the footage and use it to fuel their performance.</p>

    <h2>Ray's Apartment Window</h2>
    <p>Every sci-fi movie needs a 2001 reference. Ray's apartment view is based on the opening shot of the sun rising behind Earth.</p>
    <p>The Earth model is a custom shader with a procedural terrain and atmosphere. The sun is just an emissive blue sphere with a heavy bloom filter applied over the scene.</p>
    <p>This scene was played on a loop on a TV monitor in the equipment room we filmed in. </p>
    <p>His bed is a medical gurney that my film club inherited for free. </p>
    <p>The greebles of his apartment are just <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/ADO-Products-Provent-14-in-x-4-ft-Rafter-Vent-UPV1448050/100533902" target="_blank">taped-together rafter vent panels from Home Depot.</a></p>

    <h2>Bumoncularian Documentary</h2>
    <p>The video Ray watches on his phone in the intro was finished rendering at 2am the night before the shoot.</p>
    <p>I made 3 variations with different levels of VHS-style filtering.</p>
    <p>Bubby the Lub was sculpted in Blender, and the eye movement was made just by constraining them to face a hidden object that I moved around the scene.</p>

    <h2>Tachyon Maps</h2>
    <p>I made the Tachyon Maps overlay in Figma, based off the UI of actual navigation apps.</p>
    <p>All the other logos in the film were also made in Figma.</p>
    <p>The 3D scene was rendered in Blender using custom cell-shaded toon shaders. </p>
